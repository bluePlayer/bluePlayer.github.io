Sortable Bar Chart
===============

See [Sortable Bar Chart](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885705)

It uses "tsv" file or Tab Separated Value, and when I say tab it means the values must be separated with \t
character and not 4 white spaces. Otherwise d3.tsv() function cannot read the file and it will not show graph.

You can sort the bars with a checkbox, ascending order to be exact.
